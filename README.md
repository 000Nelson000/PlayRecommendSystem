# Recommended System Play-Ground. 
This is the place I try to figure out how to implement recommendation algos

## data sets
- movielens
- funds
- sketchFab

## Algos
- [v] nearest neighbor (User-Based CF, Item-Based CF)
	- [ ] issue: very inefficient to compute pairwise similarity(distance)
- [o] explicit matrix factorization (ALS, SGD ...)
- [o] implicit matrix factorization 
- [v] web-based funds recommendation 
- [ ] LightFM 
	- [v] not fully understand (try it first!) 
- [ ] Approximate Nearest Neighbors
	- [v] issue: can't install properyly under windows env 
		- annoy -- ubuntu16.04, windows server2012 (update conda to python 3.6 version)
		- nmslib -- failed
	- [ ] how to use it properly?
